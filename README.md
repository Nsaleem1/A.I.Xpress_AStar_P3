In Fall of 2025, we were approached by Mr. Keogh, who asked for assistance on a business problem. As he explained, he owns a port that offers a load balancing service. This service will rearrange the ship containers on the port and starboard side weights for their difference in weights to be minimal or having the weight difference be less than ten percent of the sum of their weights. All ships can be represented on a grid that fits an eight row and twelve column configuration. A manifest is provided with current information on each cell of the grid such as if there is a container and the container’s weight and content. Mr. Keogh wants us to rearrange the containers to balance the ship, provide an updated manifest file, and a log file to document the events. Based on this problem, my team concluded this can be represented as a search problem where A* is used to find a balance state. 

## FILES

controller.py : runs the program UI

main.py : runs the program without any visual

We have also included eight manifest test files for one to use and play around with.
